## 1. Sinohope WaaS MPC Technology Introduction

Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) is an important branch of digital signature. It is a cryptographic technology based on Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and an important research direction of MPC key management.

Sinohope's WaaS (Wallet as a Service) is a wallet-as-a-service solution based on MPC-TSS technology. Sinohope's WaaS service requires customers and the platform to collaborate in a distributed manner, each holding a private key sharding. Based on the [MPC-CMP protocol]( https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/060) (ECDSA) and [SS01 protocol]( https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-47719-5_33#chapter-info) (EdDSA), it implements customer-led off-chain multi-party signatures. MPC Node is a dedicated program package provided by Sinohope WaaS for customers to manage their own private key sharding.

Sinohope adopts a 3-3 multi-signature mode, where customers hold one private key sharding and Sinohope holds two private key sharding.

- MPC Node 1: Sinohope is responsible for management, and this Node will always be online.
- MPC Node 2: Sinohope is responsible for management, and this Node will always be online.
- MPC Node 3: The customer is responsible for management and should also keep the automated process always online.

```

#### 2.1.3 network requirements

##### Firewall inbound rules

- Open port 443, MPC Node service provides HTTPS service to users.
- Turn off all other ports without affecting operation and security.

##### Firewall outbound rules

- Installation phase:
  - Access to apt sources to install base dependencies
  - Access docker installation source to install docker
  - Access to docker.io registry mirroring repository
- Service phase:
  - Access to client-configured callback servers
  - Can access mpc-proxy, need to communicate with other MPC nodes when signing.
  - Turn off all other outbound IPs without affecting operation and security.

#### 2.1.4 install Docker

Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker. When the startup script in the Sinohope MPC Node installation package is executed, it will automatically check the installation status of Docker. If it is not installed, it cannot run.

### 2.2 Deployment and configuration

Deploying and configuring MPC Node is a basic requirement for using Sinohope WaaS service. Please refer to the following steps to complete the deployment and operation of MPC Node.

1. Prepare: Open Sinohope WaaS account; Prepare deployment environment, obtain and verify MPC Node installation package.
2. Initialize the node, generate the node ID and the node public key required for deploying the callback service.
3. (On demand) Deploy and configure your callback service;
4. Bind MPC Node, log in to the web console to configure MPC Node, and bind your Node ID with your organization account.
5. Start MPC Node, the node will continue to run and automatically drive the operation of MPC protocol as needed. DKG will be completed after a moment, and then the "key share status" will be "generated" in the Web Console MPC Node management interface.
6. ❗️❗️ important: back up MPC Node local database files safely and properly!

#### 2.2.1 get and verify the installation package

- Software packages (mainly management scripts and configuration files) are released through open source projects. Download link: [sinohope-mpc-node/releases](https://github.com/sinohope/sinohope-mpc-node/releases). If it is an SGX server, please use the software under production/sgx.
- The Releases page will contain the sha256 value of the main content. Please check the consistency of the hash value after downloading the content to the target location.

The required initial files are as follows:
```Bash
sinohope-mpc-node
├── config.toml （Configuration File）
└── node.sh （Manage Scripts）
```

- After successful initialization of MPC Node, the asset.db file and logs directory will be automatically created.

```JSON
sinohope-mpc-node
├── config.toml
├── node.sh
├── asset.db (Important locally generated data is stored here, and backup and recovery are the process of restoring data)
└── logs (Log file directory)
```

#### 2.2.2 Initialize Node


First, execute the following command to start the mpc-node service. The service must be started before executing any other commands.

```
sudo ./node.sh start
```
示例：
```
./node.sh start
mpc-node instance name: mpc-node, unseal server address: 127.0.0.1:10080
a0c4e4380926d588016570a5d99a7b875a997c841d70472a4bcf1972b200ec49
mpc-node server address: 127.0.0.1:10080
```

Note: Firstly, the script will automatically perform some environmental checks, such as determining whether Docker is installed and determining user permissions. If you need to run multiple mpc-nodes simultaneously on the current system, you need to distinguish them in the form of directories. If you try to run multiple mpc-nodes in the same directory, only the first initialized node can run normally. If you want to run two mpc-nodes, their names are assumed to be mpc-node-a and mpc-node-b, then you need to create two directories, their names can be: mpc-node-a and mpc-node-b. Then copy the node.sh and config.toml files to the above two directories respectively.

When deploying MPC Node for the first time, please execute the following command on the command line and complete the initialization according to the prompts.

```Bash
sudo ./node.sh init
```

Example:

```Shell
./node.sh init
New password:
Retype new password:
{"data":{"node_id":"sinoMzA1OTMwMTMwNjA3MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAyMDEwNjA4MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAzMDEwNzAzNDIwMDA0MDdlMDgyNzA5OTU1NTUxMzljODExMzQ3YTBkZjVmZjVhYmY1ZmM1MTFiOWFiM2U0MWE5N2MwMDlkODA3OGY3ZTc1MzlhYjA2M2ZkNzczZTliOTJjZWU5MjI1ZTVhMTFhYmJjNzExOWRlNDkwYjNiMzZkNTM3MWFmZDRkYjBiYzI=","public_key":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEB+CCcJlVVROcgRNHoN9f9av1/FEb\nmrPkGpfACdgHj351OasGP9dz6bks7pIl5aEau8cRneSQs7NtU3Gv1NsLwg==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"},"status":"ok"}
```

The main task of the init command is to initialize node information, including:

- Set a password for the MPC node This password is used to protect your private key sharding and other private data. Please keep it properly, do not leak it, and do a Safety Redundancy backup . The node will be required to enter the password when it starts up.
- Create a node ID. Each MPC node has a unique identifier ID. You will need to use this node ID to uniquely associate your MPC node with your WaaS organization account.
- Create an ECDSA key pair when communicating with the callback-server.

Password description:

- The password must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and be more than 12 characters in length.
- The password for sinohope-mpc-node uses a combination of t-n, and t must be less than n (such as 2-3, 3 passwords during init, and only 2 passwords at startup).
- If `storage.t` in the configuration is set to 1, init and other operation commands only need to be executed once, and the password can be generated manually.
- If `storage.t` in the configuration is greater than 1, init and other operation commands only need to be executed t times. The t-n password needs to be generated using a special tool and cannot be entered for business.
- The t-n password requires manual modification of `storage.t` and `storage.t` in config.toml.

#### 2.2.3 (Optional) Deploy and Configure Callback Service

MPC Node provides a callback mechanism for you to perform risk control, and this callback service is optional (in production environments, it is strongly recommended that you develop and deploy callback services).

After configuring the callback service for the MPC Node, the MPC Node will call back the specified interface before initiating any MPC business (such as signing), requesting authorization from the callback service for the current MPC business. Only when your callback service explicitly returns the ACCEPT status, will the MPC business begin to execute.

In addition, when you use the function of message signing or direct signing of the original data source, MPC Node will provide the signing result to you through the callback interface for your business use.

For details on the development, deployment, and configuration of callback services, please refer to the "MPC Node callback mechanism" section.

#### 2.2.4 Bind MPC Node

After completing the previous steps, you can log in to Sinohope Web Console with an account with administrator privileges, and complete the association binding of MPC Node on the "Settings" - "MPC Node" page. Here, you need to enter the Node ID generated during MPC Node initialization.


#### 2.2.5 unseal MPC Node service

After binding the MPC Node, start the MPC Node service with the following command.

```Bash
sudo ./node.sh unseal 
```

Example:

```JSON
./node.sh unseal
? Enter current password: 
{"data":"in-bkey success","status":"ok"}
```

After the service starts running, return to the web console MPC Node configuration interface. Normally, wait a moment to see the "key share status" as "generated". At the same time, the interface will display your organization's MPC root public key information.

![img](./images/mpc-node.png)


#### 2.2.6 ❗️❗️ important: database backup

The MPC Node local database file  `asset.db`  stores important data such as your private key sharding, all encrypted using a strong key derived from the password you set for MPC Node via the KDF function.

Private key sharding is related to the security and availability of funds. The private key sharding managed by Sinohope is safeguarded and backed up by a series of highly available and disaster recovery solutions based on multi-level and multi-region platforms. At the same time, you can also apply for backup of all sharding private keys of your organization, thus fully controlling all three sharding private keys.


**And for the private key sharding that exists in your local database file, you must complete the Safety Redundancy backup by yourself. Please take sufficient security measures, remote multiple copies, backup your database file, and the password you set for MPC Node.**

**It is recommended that database files be kept separate from passwords to reduce the risk of data leakage.**

**If your MPC Node server or service fails, data is damaged, or becomes unavailable in the future, you can only restore it by redeploying the MPC Node service with the database, files, and passwords you backed up. Sinohope will not be able to help you restore your MPC Node service!!**

## 3. MPC Node complete interactive command introduction

### Start

Please execute the following command in the command line:

```Bash

```

### Initialization

Please execute the following command in the command line:

```Bash
sudo ./node.sh init
```

Example:

```Shell
./node.sh init
New password:
Retype new password:
{"data":{"node_id":"sinoMzA1OTMwMTMwNjA3MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAyMDEwNjA4MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAzMDEwNzAzNDIwMDA0MDdlMDgyNzA5OTU1NTUxMzljODExMzQ3YTBkZjVmZjVhYmY1ZmM1MTFiOWFiM2U0MWE5N2MwMDlkODA3OGY3ZTc1MzlhYjA2M2ZkNzczZTliOTJjZWU5MjI1ZTVhMTFhYmJjNzExOWRlNDkwYjNiMzZkNTM3MWFmZDRkYjBiYzI=","public_key":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEB+CCcJlVVROcgRNHoN9f9av1/FEb\nmrPkGpfACdgHj351OasGP9dz6bks7pIl5aEau8cRneSQs7NtU3Gv1NsLwg==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"},"status":"ok"}
```

Note: Firstly, the script will automatically perform some environmental checks, such as determining whether Docker is installed and determining the user's control permissions. The main task of the init command is to initialize account info, including:

- Set a password for the MPC node, which is used to protect your private key sharding and other private data. Please keep it properly, do not leak it, and make a Safety Redundancy backup . The node will be required to enter the password when it starts.
- Create a node ID. Each MPC node has a unique identifier ID. You will need to use this node ID to uniquely associate your MPC node with your WaaS organization account.
- Create an ECDSA key pair when communicating with the callback-server.

### Start the service

Please execute the following command in the command line:

```Bash
./node.sh start 
```

Example:

```JSON
sudo ./node.sh start
[sudo] password for ubuntu:   (ubuntu PassWord)
? Enter password: ********
```

Note: The script will read the password and start the service in docker

### MPC Node Other Commands

Note: The main commands to start the service are init and start. Other commands are optional and can be consulted as needed.

#### View node-id and callback public key

This command can view the MPC Node ID and callback service communication public key, and can only be used when the MPC Node is running.

```JSON

```

## 4. MPC Node callback mechanism

After starting up, MPC Node will automatically establish a long link with Sinohope backend to receive tasks sent by Sinohope backend. By default, MPC Node does not enable callback mechanism, and MPC Node will automatically complete the execution of all tasks.

If the callback mechanism is enabled, the customer needs to develop a callback verification service to verify whether the tasks issued by Sinohope are reasonable and ultimately decide whether to cooperate with Sinohope to complete the signature.

The development of callback service can refer to the callback service example provided by Sinohope: [GitHub - sinohope/mpc-node-callback-demo](https://github.com/sinohope/mpc-node-callback-demo)

### 4.1 Configure the callback validation service

Some initialization configuration work needs to be done on the host where the callback server is deployed. The specific steps are as follows:

- Generate ECDSA private key for callback server

```Go
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out private_key.pem
```

- Export the ECDSA public key of the callback server

```Go
openssl ec -in private_key.pem -pubout -out callback_server_public.pem
```

- Copy the exported ECDSA public key (i.e. callback_server_public file) to the machine where the MPC Node is located, and specify the location of the callback_server_public file in the MPC Node configuration file:

```TOML
[callback]
retry-times = 60
sleep-seconds = 60
[[callback.server]]
  address = "http://127.0.0.1:9090/v1/check"
  public-key-path = "./callback_server_public.pem"
```

- Copy the MPC Node's ECDSA public key to the callback server related configuration file

How to obtain the ECDSA public key of MPC Node:

- After the initialization of MPC Node is completed, the ECDSA public key of MPC Node can be queried by the following command:

```TOML
./node.sh info
```

- Example output:

```Shell
./node.sh info   
checking update...
{
  "data": {
    "node_id": "sinoMzA1OTMwMTMwNjA3MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAyMDEwNjA4MmE4NjQ4Y2UzZDAzMDEwNzAzNDIwMDA0MmFmNGY0Y2I5ZmM1MGFjMWUzNzIxMzM2Y2IyMmJmYzMzMDg4YjJmNGM4OTEyZjZhNDE4ZmNlY2JmZWFhMzIwMjNlMzg0MGE1YjBkODI3YWE5ODE1N2Y1MTE5Y2M2YTdiYzQ2NWNmN2EzNzc0MTkwNjdmYzc5ZGNjMjQ0YjgxZTU=",
    "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEKvT0y5/FCsHjchM2yyK/wzCIsvTI\nkS9qQY/Oy/6qMgI+OEClsNgnqpgVf1EZzGp7xGXPejd0GQZ/x53MJEuB5Q==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
    "state": "unsealed"
  },
  "status": "ok"
}
```

The public key is the ECDSA public key used by MPC Node for callback service.

### 4.2 Develop callback validation service

#### 4.2.1 signature and verification

The data between MPC Node and callback service is signed by their respective ECDSA private keys, and then the other party uses the pre-configured public key to verify the signature according to the specified rules. Only when the signature is passed can it be considered a legitimate request.

The following is the data structure for communication between the current MPC Node and the callback service. Please be careful not to change the order of fields arbitrarily.

Request:

```Go
type Check struct {
    CallbackId    string `json:"callback_id,omitempty"`
    RequestType   string `json:"request_type,omitempty"`
    RequestDetail `json:"request_detail,omitempty"`
    ExtraInfo     `json:"extra_info,omitempty"`
}

type RequestDetail struct {
    T            int      `json:"t,omitempty"`
    N            int      `json:"n,omitempty"`
    Cryptography string   `json:"cryptography,omitempty"`
    PartyIds     []string `json:"party_ids,omitempty"`

    PublicKey   string `json:"public_key,omitempty"`
    Path        string `json:"path,omitempty"`
    Message     string `json:"message,omitempty"`
    Coin        string `json:"coin,omitempty"`
    FromAddress string `json:"from_address,omitempty"`
    ToAddress   string `json:"to_address,omitempty"`
    Amount      string `json:"amount,omitempty"`
    Fee         string `json:"fee,omitempty"`
    GasPrice    string `json:"gas_price,omitempty"`
    GasLimit    string `json:"gas_limit,omitempty"`
    Signature   string `json:"signature,omitempty"`
}

type ExtraInfo struct {
    SinoId    string `json:"sino_id,omitempty"`
    RequestId string `json:"request_id,omitempty"`
}
```

Response:

```Go
type Response struct {
    Status    string        `json:"status,omitempty"`
    Error     string        `json:"error,omitempty"`
    Data      *ResponseData `json:"data,omitempty"`
    Signature string        `json:"signature,omitempty"`
}

type ResponseData struct {
    CallbackId string `json:"callback_id,omitempty"`
    SinoId     string `json:"sino_id,omitempty"`
    RequestId  string `json:"request_id,omitempty"`
    Action     string `json:"action,omitempty"`
    WaitTime   string `json:"wait_time,omitempty"`
}
```

##### 1. Generate Request Signature

- MPC Node constructs a Check structure based on the type of request.
- Serialize the constructed Check structure in JSON to obtain the Message.
- MPC Node uses its own ECDSA private key to sign the message and obtain the signature.
- MPC Node sets Signature to the HTTP request header, with Key as Sigature.

##### 2. Request signature verification

- The callback service uses the Check structure to parse the HTTP request of the MPC Node and obtain the Check data of this request.
- The callback service serializes the Check data obtained in JSON to obtain the Message to be verified.
- The callback service obtains the Signature from the HTTP request, and then verifies the Signature by combining Mesage and the pre-configured MPC Node public key.

##### 3. Generate Response Signature

- The callback service generates the above Response based on its own decision and fills the corresponding fields in the Response.Data.
- The callback service serializes the Response.Data in JSON to obtain the Message.
- The callback service uses its own ECDSA private key to sign the Message, obtains the Signature, and assigns the Signature to the Response. Signature field.

##### 4. Response signature verification

- MPC Node receives the response of the callback service and serializes the Response.Data field in JSON to obtain the Message.
- MPC Node verifies Response. Signature by combining Message and pre-configured callback service public key.

#### 4.2.2 check

Each time the keygen and sign business mpc-node will request the user for risk control through the check interface. Only when the callback service explicitly replies Approve can the relevant business be allowed to start.
