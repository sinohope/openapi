# â›“ New Vault

Before creating a vault, you need to deploy and configure MPC NODE.
For details, see: <https://docs.sinohope.com/docs/develop/mpc-waas-api/quick-start/qs-1-waas/>
After completing the configuration, on the "WaaS wallets" interface, you can complete the creation of the vault through the "New Vault" function.
