# ðŸ”‘ API Key

Each treasury needs to be configured independently, including API Key settings, callback settings, advanced function switch settings, etc. You need to create a pair of ECDSA key pairs for WaaS API request authentication.

In addition, you can also create your key pair through Sinohope official SDK, java example.
